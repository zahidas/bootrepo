                        <h5>Tesla‚Äôs mission is to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy</h5>
                        <p>
                            Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn‚Äôt
                            need to compromise to drive electric ‚Äì that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and
                            more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but
                            also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the
                            faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the
                            better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla‚Äôs cutting-edge battery technology and electric
                            powertrain. From there, Tesla designed the world‚Äôs first ever premium all-electric sedan
                            from the ground up ‚Äì Model S ‚Äì which has become the best car in its class in every category.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world‚Äôs expectations
                            for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air
                            software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of
                            2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with Model
                            X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star
                            safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety
                            Administration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Completing CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúSecret Master Plan,‚Äù in 2016, Tesla introduced
                            Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon
                            after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever ‚Äì Tesla Semi ‚Äì which is
                            designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In
                            2019, Tesla unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck,
                            which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports
                            car.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tesla vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai.
                            To achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive
                            approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training
                            program before ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to
                            provide on-the-job training and track performance daily so that improvements can be made
                            quickly. The result is that Tesla‚Äôs safety rate continues to improve while production ramps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of
                            energy solutions, Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and
                            utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting
                            Tesla‚Äôs automotive and energy products is Gigafactory 1 ‚Äì a facility designed to
                            significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla
                            manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating
                            thousands of jobs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla
                            continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately
                            accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy production. Electric cars,
                            batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when
                            combined, they become even more powerful ‚Äì that‚Äôs the future we want.
